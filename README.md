2)[TSTableView](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/27615) Good plugin for work with tables. Usage is similar to the TableViewController in ios development: create a prefab cell and table is filled with cells dynamically during scrolling.

It's easy to use with Label - just add a new component to the text and specify the key identifier. Unfortunately, in March 2017, the author stopped development. Plugin now available on free access on github. I used it in two of my games, there were no complaints.

# Leaderboards

1)[Google Play Games plugin](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity) plugin for leaderboards on android and ios. Unity has a Social interface. It is has implementation for ios, but has not on android. This plugin help for android leaderboard. There were several compatibility issues with other android plugins, they were solved by removing duplicates of aar and jar files, re-importing the Unity Jar Resolver folder, clicking the Resolve client jars button, downgrading the android build tools.
